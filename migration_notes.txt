      -- @match.update(pitched: true)
    4. girl learns about pitch
      -- @match.update(pitchee_seen: true)

# Potential logic for setting match UI for various match states
  #guy logic -- SAME AS GALS
  if @convo.locked? && !@convo.pitched?
    #guy can only send one message
  elsif @convo.locked? && @convo.pitched?
    #guy can do nothing
  elsif !@convo.locked?
    #messages can be exchanged freely
  end

  #gal logic -- SAME AS GIRLS
  if @convo.locked? && !@convo.pitched?
   #gal knows nothing
  elsif @convo.locked? && @convo.pitched?
    #girl is notified of new pitch
  elsif !@convo.locked?
    #messages can be exchanged freely
  end
