TODO: figure out conversation logic and schema -- 
    - Questions:
      -- How do you know which pitches a gal has seen?
          --- Maybe: add a :seen boolean to Conversations?
      -- How are conversations associated with users?

clas Conversation #would be inited when match is made
  # locked :bool, default: false
  # pitched :bool, default: false

  has_many :messages

end

#guy logic -- SAME AS GALS
if @convo.locked? && !@convo.pitched?
  #guy can only send one message
elsif @convo.locked? && @convo.pitched?
  #guy can do nothing
elsif !@convo.locked?
  #messages can be exchanged freely
end

#gal logic -- SAME AS GIRLS
if @convo.locked? && !@convo.pitched?
 #gal knows nothing
elsif @convo.locked? && @convo.pitched?
  #girl is notified of new pitch
elsif !@convo.locked?
  #messages can be exchanged freely
end

class Message
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :conversation
end
